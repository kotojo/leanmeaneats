Lean Mean Eats is a web application used for people to make meals and track the nutritional value of those meals using the USDA's National Nutrient Database API.
Lean Mean Eats allows people to search the USDA's database for all foods to put together into meals, and then shows them the full daily nutritional value of the total meal.
