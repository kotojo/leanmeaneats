# Lean Mean Eats
### A nutrition application by Bruce Kellerman
---

Lean Mean Eats is a web application used for people to make meals and track the nutritional value of those meals using the USDA's National Nutrient Database API.
Lean Mean Eats allows people to search the USDA's database for all foods to put together into meals, and then shows them the full daily nutritional value of the total meal.

## Technologies used in developement
  * [Angular - fullstack generator](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack)
  * [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/)
  * [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/)
  * [Mongoose.js](http://mongoosejs.com/)
  * [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/)
  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Future ideas
* Implement OAuth for something like Fitbit or myFitnessPal so people could use their already created meals to track on their phone during the day, and import that data into LeanMeanEats.
* Saved full meal plans to use for the future.
* Auto suggest meals to balance out what they already ate for the day.
